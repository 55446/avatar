 news.2.d:0 "A wild population of bears has been discovered in the Eastern reaches of the Earth Kingdom. Considered an anomaly among wildlife, these bears have no supplementary features to speak of, instead owing their distinct look to an overwhelming 'plainness' as described by researchers. Their rarity puts them at great risk due to poaching, which has prompted conservationists to demand royal protection be placed on these fascinating creatures."

With their stronghold in the South, Chin supporters demand the continuation of Qinchao's aggressive stance, promising an eventual defeat of Kyoshi Island as retribution for Chin's death.
