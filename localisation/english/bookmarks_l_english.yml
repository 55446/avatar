 THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "For a long time the four nations lived together in harmony, but with uneven prosperity. Among these, the Fire Nation rose to great power, and great ambitions, during Fire Lord Sozin's rule attempts were made to expand their territory in the Earth Kingdom, but these ambitions were twarthed by Avatar Roku. But Roku is dead, the new Avatar is but a child, and the Great Comet's arrival is nigh, who can stop the Fire Nation now?"
 EAR_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The mighty Earth Kingdom, the largest and most populated realm the World has ever seen, its people are diverse, strong and steadfast... A curse disguised as blessing. For hundreds of years the kingdom has been plagued by petty rivalry, unrest and conflict... Meanwhile its Kings hide safely behind the many walls of Ba Sing Se where they are fed lies by their increasingly ambitious and shrewd advisors. As the kingdom slowly slips from royal grasp, Jackals from the West have already encroached on our shores, unopposed, and the King's inaction required the Avatar's action to drive the Fire Nation away. But now the Avatar is but a child..."
 SWT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The South Pole is a harsh and unforgiving place... and yet, the people of the South have lived and thrived here for hundreds of generations. There is no hardship that the Watertribesmen cannot adapt and overcome. Dark clouds gather, the world is getting more dangerous by the day, the oceans are restless and the moon shines an ominous light, the elders talk of a great evil about to come... But regardless of what lies ahead, our people will resist, adapt, and overcome. A thousand years from now the Southern Water tribes will still sing under the same moon, and dance under the same ice. "
 NWT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Merchants from the south come bringing whispers and speculation of a great war to come, the meek and the alarmist make great tides out of a pond, but our people and our proud traditions are safe, protected by trecherous waters of the Arctic and the mighty ice walls of our glaciers. No enemy is foolish enough to set foot on Northern land, and should any force, drunk on power and madness dare to set foot on our ancestral home, then it will deal with the immense fury of our brave warriors, who will go the greatest sacrifices necessary and them some more, in order to protect their kin and culture."
 FIR_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Long past are the days of isolated, backwards and powerhungry warring clans struggling for power in the Fire Islands. Ever since united under the iron fist of the Royal Family, the Fire Nation has began experiencing an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity... But the fire of ambition still burns deep inside every firebender in these islands, and now Fire Lord Sozin looks East, the time has come for the Fire Nation to assume its dominant role in the world and lead its uncivilised peoples to enlightenment, by force if necessary. The time of flame and blade is nigh!"
 SAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Amidst the foggy cliffs of the Patola mountains, the new Avatar has been reborn, and thus the Southern Air temple will play the decisive role in the troubling times to come, on their hands is the task raising, trainning and preparing the young Avatar to return peace and balance to such an increasingly volatile and dangerous world."
 WAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The Western Air temple has always been the least isolated and most vulnerable of the air temples, being populated entierly by women and standing at the crossroads between the influence of the Fire Nation, Earth Kingdom and Northern Water Tribes. Thus, these temples were built strategically upside-down under a cragg between the mountains, out of sight and out of reach from any outside threat. But of course, no hideout is perfect, and no fortress is impregnable."
 EAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The Eastern Air temple has been the home of the last Airbender Avatar, Yangchen, and thus her doctrine is still very much present among the women of this temple. Yangchen's teachings were quite unorthodox for a typical pacifist airbender way, and didn't shy away from the use of stern, decisive action and even violence if strictly necessary to achieve the greater good."
 NAT_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The Northern Air temple, inhabited exclusively by men, stands imposingly amidst the largest and highest mountain range of the world, its close proximity to the north pole makes this temple a haven of life amidst a dangerous and inhospitable land. Despite directly bordering the great Earth Kingdom this temple has always retained independence and avoided conflict due to the natural buffer zone provided by the Taihua Range."
 KYI_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "In an age long since passed, the sovereignty of the Yokoya Peninsula was once threatened by the seemingly unstoppable might of Chin the Conqueror and his armies. Avatar Kyoshi intervened to defend her homeland, utilizing the Avatar State to forcefully separate the peninsula from the mainland, creating what would become known as Kyoshi Island. The descendents of this struggle have preserved Kyoshi's legacy through their unique warrior culture and enduring isolationism, hoping to forever keep the threat of war off their shores."
 POH_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The discovery of vast metal deposits has quickly turned the once unremarkable province of Hu Bao into an emerging power in the Western Earth Kingdom. With rumors of a great Industrial Revolution in the Fire Nation, Hu Bao's valuable trove of resources makes it a prime candidate to compete internationally as an industrial powerhouse."
 TAK_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "The beating heart of international commerce, the city-state of Taku has enjoyed great wealth and prosperity under the careful guidance of its powerful merchant families. Being responsible for distributing cargo throughout the Earth Kingdom, Taku's strategic importance is a fact not ignored by Ba Sing Se, nor the many would-be warlords seeking to claim its regional power for their own."
 OMS_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "Second only to Ba Sing Se, the great Kingdom of Omashu has flourished in recent times due to its expanded trade networks and charitable social decrees. Its imposing capital remains a strategic stronghold in maintaining dominance in the Southern Earth Kingdom."

 OTHER_THE_HUNDRED_YEARS_WAR_DESC:0 "It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it become rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations, will help you become whole."

 WAR_WATER_NAME:0 "War on the Poles"
 WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "Everything has changed. Forty years ago the Fire Nation struck the Air Nomads, viciously and ruthlessly, showing no mercy, and the rest of the world was not allowed to grieve for they to were under direct threat. The Fire Nation invaded the Earth Kingdom, scored impressive victories and shows no signs of being stopped. But now they set a new target, the Water Tribes, for the elusive Avatar had slipped the Airbender onslaught, and should he die, by sword or old age, he is sure to be reborn as a Waterbender."
 FIR_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "The indomitable will of Fire Nation fire_culture continues to scorch everything in its path. Having entrenched themselves in the Western lands once belonging to the Earth Kingdom, The Fire Nation army now sets its sights on the Water Tribes, hoping to score an early victory against the homelands of a potential Avatar."
 EAR_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "The shocking development of the Fire Nation's invasion has uprooted the lives of many native Earth Kingdom commoners, demanding a dramatic mobilization of every able-bodied citizen to fend off the Fire Nation invaders. While still comfortably distant from the front lines, Ba Sing Se struggles with internal strife, threatening the rule of its dynastic legacy."
 SWT_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "With the war now isolating them from their sister tribe, the fiercesome warriors of the South are left on their own to defend against the might of the Fire Nation. Unless major reforms are made to modernize its industrial capacity for war, the Southern Water Tribe will have to utilize the protection of its vast frozen wastelands to halt the Fire Nation's advance."
 NWT_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "Seeing the continued success of the Fire Nation's offensive against the Earth Kingdom, it is believed that only a matter of time remains before the same fate awaits the Northern Water Tribe. While admittably inferior to the terrifying technological prowess of the Fire Nation, the master waterbenders of the North provide a powerful bulwark against any attempted naval encroachment."
 XIN_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "Prior to the Great War, the city-state of Garsai was once the breadbasket of the Western Earth Kingdom. Now, it's at the center of a brutal Fire Nation offensive to consolidate colonial power in the region. As Earth Kingdom forces funnel in to defend its territories, the fate of Garsai has yet to be seen."
 NIX_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "Hu Xin once enjoyed peace with its Water Tribe and Air Nomad visitors, providing it with a rich, diverse culture. However, with the Air Temples wiped out and the Water Tribes on the back foot, the people of Hu Xin must pick up arms to defend their homes."
 MER_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "The state of Chenbao has had a long, troubled history of being at the center of military skirmishes between the surrounding nations. This unfortunate tradition appears to remain even to this day, as Fire Nation soldiers march North, attempting to push forward to the great city of Ba Sing Se."
 GDD_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "The awe-inspiring canyons of the Great Divide have offered great protection against the Fire Nation army, yet many displaced citizens from the Western Earth Kingdom are forced to cross its perilous terrain to escape the reach from the now-occupied Fire Nation territories. Dangerous rockslides and ferocious wildlife notwithstanding, this unassuming province may just turn the tide of the war."
 HEB_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "Hebai is a province well known for its connection to the Spirit World, a trait most often observed from its lush forests and calming natural springs. As such, the people of Hebai tend to be very spiritual and superstitious, sharply increasing their population of earthbenders. "
 OMS_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Omashu has held a vital position in arms manufacturing, supplying the Earth Kingdom with the necessary weapons of war, all from the convenience of its novel earth-powered delivery system. Lorded over with an even hand by the "Mad Genious" King Bumi, Omashu's direct role in the war has been tenuous at best, but increased pressure from Fire Navy invasions may change this posture."
 LAM_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "The mountains of Taihua are said to be treacherous beyond measure, and are home to howling blizzards that could freeze a traveler's feet to the ground. Its dangerous mountains have been said to have swallowed entire armies in the days of Ba Sing Se's founding, an ancient folkstale that Taihua residents hope continues to hold true."
 NOW_WAR_WATER_DESC:0 "Nestled away in the Northwestern plains of the Earth Kingdom, the province of Liandu has long benefited with its autonomy from Ba Sing Se. Its local economies have prospered from an expanded mining industry, a prize that the Fire Nation greatly covets."

 GENERAL_IROH_NAME:0 "The Siege of Ba Sing Se"
 GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "After 94 years, the war is coming to an end, the Air Nomads dead, the Southern Water tribe on its knees and the Northern Water Tribe on the run, hiding behind their walls of ice. The once mighty Earth Kingdom is on the brink of collapse, with the full might of the Fire Nation's armies now surrounding the walls of Ba Sing Se. Leading the siege is the crown prince General Iroh, the infamous "Dragon of the West", who aims to finally wrest the great city under Fire Nation control."
 EAR_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "The enemy is at the gates, pursuing a decisive breakthrough. The enduring last stand of the Earth Kingdom's royal army may determine the fate of the entire war. Unfortunately for Earth King Kuei, knowledge of the war is purposely withheld from him by his underhanded Dai Li advisor, Long Feng. Operating a powerful shadow government from the secrecy of their underground facilities, the Dai Li now exercise control over much of Ba Sing Se."
 SWT_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "What remains of the Southern Water Tribe is left in shambles. Many Southern warriors have left the homeland to aid the defense of the Earth Kingdom, and what few waterbenders remained were slowly captured in Fire Nation raids, rumored to be sent off to horrifying prisons. The children of the Southern Water Tribe are told bedtime stories of the terrible Fire Nation army, fostering a new generation filled with fear and resentment."
 NWT_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "The Northern Water Tribe has adopted an unfliching policy of isolation as a final stand against the Fire Nation. Holding steadfast behind their walled cities, the combined forces of the North continue to disrupt Fire Navy forces through the use of effective hit-and-run tactics, though these efforts have not gone unnoticed, and may usher swift retaliation."
 FIR_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "Fire Lord Azulon seeks the great prize of victory in this nearly century-long war, hoping to finally crush any last pockets of resistance before achieving total domination over the Earth Kingdom. With terrifying new weapons of war at the disposal of his armies, there may be little hope left among his enemies to defy his resolve."
 WBA_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "Kangfao, one of the two aptly named 'shield provinces', fought bravely in its defense of the capital, but the might of the Fire Nation army was unpredented, and pushed back the defenders. To successfuly break the siege on Ba Sing Se, Kangfao may need to set its sights on new tactics and maneuvers."
 FMB_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "Full Moon Bay has become an important stop for many refugees seeking the protection of Ba Sing Se. Hidden ports ferry those fortunate enough to afford tickets across the East Lake. All others may be forced to traverse the Serpent's pass, a dangerous strip of land named after the ferocious sealife that dwells near."
 OMS_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "With the threat of Fire Nation camps in its territory, the Great War has finally arrived to Omashu's doorsteps. King Bumi's apparent disregard for the situation has raised eyebrows among his subjects, but his leadership has not failed Omashu yet."
 EBA_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "Gintong tirelessly attacks the Fire Nation's lines, hoping to eventually break the siege that surrounds the capital. Only with the combined efforts of the remaining Earth Kingdom territories can General Iroh be pushed back."
 NAT_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "Under the watchful guidance of the esteemed Mechanist, many Earth Kingdom refugees braved the elements to ascend the Northern Air Temple. Having made a new home for themselves amid the ruins of a lost culture, the Mechanist was captivated by the murals of airbenders using gliders to soar the skies, and decided to utilize his engineering prowess to grant the power of flight to his non-bending followers."
 MPO_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "The great Si Wong Desert spans much of the Southern Earth Kingdom, and due to the nature of its scorching heat and perilous terrain, the many tribes that inhabit the Si Wong have enjoyed near total autonomy from the Earth Kingdom for much of their history. Without a central authority, the tribes of Si Wong make decicions for themselves, and crime is often handled through vigilante justice."
 GAO_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "Gaoling hosts a large amount of important noble families, such as the Beifongs, as well as an underground earthbending tournament. Although Gaoling's administration is deeply connected with the noble families, the unmistakable amount of riches netted from their cooperation allows for the procurement of high-end equipment for the war effort."
 ZAO_GENERAL_IROH_DESC:0 "Qinchao is a notable province for its unique cultures and customs, found nowhere else in the Earth Kingdom. With many of its residents being descendents of the Chin clan, Qinchao maintains a close relationship with its neighboring state of Teji."

 THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_NAME:0 "The Boy in the Iceberg"
 THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the War. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads, and that the cycle is broken. But somehow the Avatar might still return to save the world."
 EAR_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "After its victory over General Iroh's daunting siege, Ba Sing Se enjoys a brief, if uneasy, peace. Earth Kingdom refugees flock to the great city to start new lives, hoping that its mighty walls continue to keep the Fire Nation at bay. To maintain an orderly society admist the chaotic influx of displaced refugees, the subversive Dai Li cultural authority has forbid any mention of the war within the safety of the walls, quietly removing any would-be dissenters."
 SWT_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Life is quiet in the South, and much colder than usual. What was once a bustling society of tribes with rich cultural histories has now been reduced to a smattering of small, defenseless villages all desperate to outlast the war and move on with their lives.\n\n This now unremarkable chapter in the Southern Water Tribe's history may end sooner than expected, however..."
 NWT_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Stacks of smoke are seen on the horizon, reminding the once proud tribes of the North that little separates them from the Fire Nation war machine. Rumors of an imminent full-fledged invasion keep the chiefdom occupied, indicating that the last bastions of Water Tribe culture may soon face its last stand."
 FIR_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Fire Lord Ozai represents the height of his nation's jingoistic attitude, eager to usher in a new age of imperialistic cruelty to crush his enemies once and for all. Having exiled his son Prince Zuko for speaking out of turn, Ozai now confides in his cunning daughter Azula to bring about total world domination for the people of the Fire Nation."
 KYI_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Despite their best efforts at maintaining neutrality, the effects of a century-long war have been too crushing to ignore. There is talk among the Kyoshi Warriors on traveling abroad, aiding war efforts on the side of the Earth Kingdom, but this decision still remains in the hands of Kyoshi's Governor."
 NCB_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Xishaan was once the pride of the Earth Kingdom's shipbuilding industry, but the Fire Nation has since captured its dockyards and now uses them to constuct vessels for the Fire Navy. Not alone in its efforts to liberate its land from Fire Nation occupation, warriors from the Southern Water Tribe have set up camps in the region, helping to repel Fire Nation warships in the Chameleon Bay."
 OMS_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "King Bumi tends to spend more time feasting and bonding with his pet Goat Gorilla than attending to the developing war situation, greatly angering his military advisors. Bumi's eccentric commands and bewildering tactics have their dissenters, but some of Omashu's elderly residents do cite the claimed wisdom behind his actions."
 SWA_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "The Foggy Bottom Swamp is usually avoided by travelers due to its dense vegetation, aggressive wildlife and frightening spirit sightings. Behind this treacherous exterior hides a small, thriving subculture of waterbenders who specialize in manipulating the stagnant swamp water and moist plant life."
 ISL_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "The Shimsom Islands have historically been important trade hubs between the Earth Kingdom and the Southern Water Tribe. This partnership was best seen with its abundance of Water Tribe fairs, trading posts and traditional Water Tribe lodgings. Those days have since become ancient history, leaving Shimsom to deal only with Earth Kingdom shipping lanes."
 SNW_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Believed by many to have completely disappeared, the Sun Warrior civilization maintains an ancient culture of firebending and dragon worship, fiercely opposed to the aggressive, imperialist path taken by the Fire Nation. The Sun Warrior's firebending comes the sun's energy, focusing on physical heat as well as spiritual enlightenment and idealism."
 HEB_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "While not strategically important enough to demand total occupation, Hebai was still ravaged by Fire Nation raids, resulting in a large section of its great forests being burnt to the ground. The ramifications were felt by many village elders, who fear the ire of the angered spirits who had made the forests their home."
 CHN_THE_BOY_IN_THE_ICEBERG_DESC:0 "Centuries after the collapse of Chin's empire, his legacy lives on in the Southwestern province of Teji. Known for their devout appreciation of Chin's conquests, as well as their unique judicial system, the people of Teji respect the power of a rugged, vigourous leader who is not afraid to replicate and restore the honor of Chin the Conqueror."
