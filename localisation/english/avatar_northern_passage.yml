 north_passage.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] wants to restore diplomatic relations"
 north_passage.1.d:0 "Our conflict that had been lasting for around half a century by now got overshadowed by far larger event. Namely, with the return of the Great Comet few weeks ago, Fire Nation brought a decisive action, and had currently erased the entire Air Nation from this world. While our disagreements with the country across the Northern Sea still stand, [THIS.GetName] and [FROM.GetName] had came to the negotiation table to end the disagreement hopefully forever. Our countries look forward to establishing the united Anti-Sozin front."
 north_passage.1.a:0 "Together for Victory!"
 north_passage.2.t:0 "Northern Water ship captured"
 north_passage.2.d:0 "Our coastal guard had reported Northern Water Tribe ship entering our port. While our troops came to check the ship, they reported that there was some suspicious assets on the ship. On top of that, after questioning the captain of the ship, he admitted that he has not enough money for our tarrifs, and more of it, he said that he never knew of the tarrifs even existing in first place. This is our golden opportunity to hit at our opponent on the other side of the Northern Sea, as we are able to confiscate the entire ship and imprison their crew while claiming that it is our laws that allow us that. We can hold the crew hostage to force Northern Water Tribe to accept our demands, but as they are waterbenders it is unlikely for us to capture them all before they ran to the shore and across the Northern Sea into their base."
 north_passage.2.a:0 "Capture the ship"
 north_passage.2.b:0 "Let them pass, we can't allow more enemies now."
 north_passage.3.t:0 "Ship Captured by Earth Kingdom"
 north_passage.3.d:0 "Our ship, that was sent to the Earth Kingdom, carrying various items for trade in the warmer areas was captured by Chenbao authorities. They tried to imprison it's crew to hold them hostage, but all of the waterbenders managed to escape through sea for long enough until our patrols had spotted them. As this action is nothing else other than diplomatic threat, we are able to answer to their move by the actual threat. They should know to never mess with Water Tribe navy."
 north_passage.3.a:0 "Send in the Navy"
 north_passage.4.t:0 "Northern Water Tribe provocation"
 north_passage.4.d:0 "Our scouts had reported a large number of the Water Tribe ships that most certainly belong to the Northern Tribe. It is most certainly just show of power and to present that they will not tolerate our recent move. Now, we have the ability to take out our navy and show our strength too, shoving our navy dangerously close to their ship in an attempt to intimidate them, but then again, this isn't entire Northern Water Tribe navy, and they for sure have way more ships than we do. Perhaps best option would be to petition Earth King to know if he will be on our side. Though then again, war is the last thing we need right now with Sozin flexing his strength for some action, probably on Earth Kingdom considering how it is the richest place on earth with a lot of ore, luxury stuff and it's lands are fertile compared to the Fire Nation mainland, where it is overcrowded. Perhaps the best option would be to swallow our pride and back down. We won't be able to fight against Water Tribe and Fire Nation alone."

 north_passage.4.c:0 "We can ill afford war with Water Tribes"
 north_passage.5.t:0 "Chenbao pleads for aid"
 north_passage.5.d:0 "Our humble constituent state of Chenbao had requested our aid in their struggle against Northern Water Tribe. Namely, their conflict from even Roku's era had restarted again, now that there is no Avatar yet to fix the dispute for good. Chenbao had unilaterally restored the tarrifs that existed before Roku's intervention and took Northern Water Tribe ship which had no money to cover our tarrifs, as well as it's nonbending crew hostage. We have good reason to join the struggle against the Northern Water Tribe, at least to show the power of Earth King and remove our rival in the north, but our scouts report increasing world tension with another country, Sozin's Fire Nation. As such, perhaps it would be prudent to start the reconcilation with the Water tribes as they would for sure be good ally, their waterbending would come to be very handy in stopping the possible invasions."
 north_passage.5.a:0 "Fulfil their request"
 north_passage.5.b:0 "We have more pressing concerns"
