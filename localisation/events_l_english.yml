 news.3.d:0 "A wild population of bears has been discovered to roam the eastern coast of the earth kingdom, this species has been declared extinct 72 years ago with the exception being the earth king's beloved bosco. According to researchers the bear unlike its relatives, likes to collect and share metal objects (such as hammers and sickles) amongst it's bear and platypus bear comrades. Apparantly much like the earth king's Bosco, the bear is very loyal and appears to not be able to survive on its own as well as its closely related platypus bear does, researchers believe this to be the reason why they lived so closely to the platypus bear."
